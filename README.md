# Ridge Racer Revolution Unlocked 
* Unlocks the two courses from the original Ridge Racer: "Seaside Route 765" and "Ridge City Highway" which are normally only accessible in two player link cable games.

* Unlocks all 5 courses in the "Extra" variants (reversed).

* Unlocks all 15 cars in the game

### Requirements
An uncompressed CD image with the EUR or US version of Ridge Racer Revolution.

### Limitations
* Car types / speed levels are not unlocked
  * I gave up after spending about four hours not getting it to work right.

* Race Scene Selection not unlocked
  * I didn't think of it until I started writing this.

* Time trial mode not patched
  * There are some GameShark codes that makes it possible to select the special courses, and in their notes it is mentioned that time trial mode can cause the game to crash when playing these courses. No attempts have been made to remedy this.

### Disclaimer
I have not yet verified the hacks on a console, but I expect everything to work fine. I have tested the courses and the cars in emulators, though far from all combinations of game modes, courses and cars, hence there might be bugs somewhere that I did not account for.

This is my very first ROM hack, first disassembly, first experience with MIPS and PS1, etc. It probably ain't pretty, but I tried to aim for the least invasive way to perform the modifications and not having to distribute a copy of the game.
