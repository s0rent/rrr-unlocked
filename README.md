### Requirements
An uncompressed CD image with the EUR or US version of Ridge Racer Revolution.

### Disclaimer
I have not yet verified the hacks on a console, but I expect everything to work fine. I have tested the courses and the cars in emulators, though far from all combinations of game modes, courses and cars, hence there might be bugs somewhere that I did not account for.

This is my very first ROM hack, first disassembly, first experience with MIPS and PS1, etc. It probably ain't pretty, but I tried to aim for the least invasive way to perform the modifications and not having to distribute a copy of the game.
