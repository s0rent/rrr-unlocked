### Requirements
An uncompressed CD image with the EUR or US version of Ridge Racer Revolution.

### Disclaimer
I have not tested every combination of game modes, courses and cars, so there might be bugs somewhere that I did not encounter.

This is my very first ROM hack, first disassembly, first experience with MIPS and PS1, etc. It probably ain't pretty, but I tried to aim for the least invasive way to perform the modifications and not having to distribute a copy of the game.
